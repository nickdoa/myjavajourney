# myjavajourney
Welcome to My Java Learning Journey repository! This repository contains all the Java projects and code that I have developed as part of my journey to learn Java programming. As a beginner in Java, I started by learning the basics such as variables, data types, operators, and control statements. I then progressed to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming.

By sharing this repository, I hope to inspire other Java beginners to start their own learning journey and to contribute to the open-source community. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to this repository. Let's learn Java together!"
